Product Price Classification

Course: NLP (Semester 6) - Pillai College of Engineering

Project Overview : 

This project focuses on classifying products into predefined price ranges—Low, Medium, and High—using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). Instead of relying on direct price data, the system analyzes product descriptions to predict price categories. By leveraging advanced NLP techniques and various ML models, this project aims to enhance product search and price-based decision-making for e-commerce platforms. Traditional price categorization relies on direct price data, which can be inconsistent due to discounts and currency variations. This system introduces a text-based classification approach, making product categorization more scalable and flexible. It benefits both consumers and retailers by improving search filtering, optimizing pricing strategies, and automating classification to reduce manual effort.

Project Title :

Product Price Classification 

Project Abstract:

This project classifies products into Low, Medium, and High price categories using NLP and machine learning. It extracts insights from product descriptions and applies classification algorithms to predict price ranges. By utilizing ML, deep learning models, and advanced language models, the project evaluates various approaches for accuracy and effectiveness. Text preprocessing techniques like tokenization and word embeddings convert product descriptions into numerical representations. Models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN , Naive Bayes and BERT are tested to determine the most effective classification method. This system automates price categorization, benefiting e-commerce platforms by improving product organization, aiding marketing strategies, and enhancing consumer insights.
