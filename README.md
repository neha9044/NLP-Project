Product Price Classification

Course: NLP (Semester 6) - Pillai College of Engineering

Project Overview : 

The goal of this project is to combine machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to classify products into three predetermined price ranges: low, medium, and high. The algorithm predicts price categories by analyzing product descriptions rather than using raw price data. The goal of this project is to improve product search and price-based decision-making for e-commerce platforms by utilizing a variety of ML models and sophisticated NLP approaches. Because of discounts and currency fluctuations, direct pricing data—which is the foundation of traditional price categorization—can be erratic. By using a text-based classification strategy, this system increases the scalability and flexibility of product categorization. By enhancing search filtering, optimizing pricing tactics, and automating classification to minimize manual labor, it helps both customers and retailers.

Project Title :

Product Price Classification 

Project Abstract:

This project uses machine learning and natural language processing to classify products into three price ranges: low, medium, and high. In order to forecast price ranges, it uses categorization algorithms and gathers information from product descriptions. Through machine learning, deep learning models, and sophisticated language models, the study assesses several methods for precision and efficacy. Product descriptions are transformed into numerical representations using text preprocessing methods like tokenization and word embeddings. To find the best classification technique, models including Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN, Naive Bayes, and BERT are tested. By automating pricing classification, this method helps e-commerce platforms by facilitating marketing tactics, improving user insights, and organizing products better.
